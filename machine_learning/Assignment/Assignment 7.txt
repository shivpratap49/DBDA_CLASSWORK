The model's main purpose is to predict the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). CHD is a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart. Heart disease has been the leading cause of death worldwide since 1921. In 2008, 7.3 million people died from CHD. 
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
Variables
Sex: male or female(0=female, 1=male)
Age: Age of the patient
education: Some high school (1), high school/GED (2), some college/vocational school (3), college (4)
Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker (0=No, 1=Yes)
Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day
BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication 
Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (0=No, 1=Yes)
Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (0=No, 1=Yes)
Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (0=No, 1=Yes)
Tot Chol: total cholesterol level
Sys BP: systolic blood pressure 
Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure
BMI: Body Mass Index
Heart Rate: heart rate
Glucose: glucose level
